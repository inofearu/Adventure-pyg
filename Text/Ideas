IDEAS:
#Maybe we can allow the player to call functions, quick travel, etc.
#to do that we would need a console which player runs messages in but that kind of stuff can get complicated fast
player_commands = ['exit','qt','e']
#qt being quick travel, e being the button for inventory(will there be a inventory, or only having 1 slot for handheld items and how would that work?)
#maybe this kind of thing as the players input?
while game == running:
 player_command = input('> ')
 if player_command in player_commands:
   if player_command in ['qt']:
     print('where you want to quick travel?')
